# Benchmarks

Every benchmark iteration gets its own file here, written right after the run: what was tested, how, the numbers, and
what we concluded. That includes runs that made things worse and changes that were thrown away. Older results, from
before this folder existed, are in [ENGINEERING.md](../ENGINEERING.md).

## Iterations

| Date | File | What was tested | Result |
|---|---|---|---|

## Template

Name the file `YYYY-MM-DD-<short-slug>.md` and add a row to the table above.

```markdown
# <What was tested, as a sentence>

- **Question:** what this run was meant to find out, and why.
- **Code:** the commit or branch of each side (and of codefusion-dotnet, for a contest entry).
- **Machine:** the hardware or VM shape, OS, .NET SDK, Postgres or SQLite version, and what else was running.
- **Method:** the tool and its settings (BenchmarkDotNet job, load generator and users, the contest's scoring steps),
  the rounds and their order, and how the result was picked (best of, median of).

| Case | Before | After | Change |
|---|---|---|---|

- **Memory and CPU:** RSS, GC heap, allocations per request, CPU per request, where measured.
- **Conclusion:** what we learned, what we keep or revert, and what to try next.
